that receives a spaceship name and light speed increase value 
and increases spaceship light speed only if the given spaceship 
exists. If the modifying is not successful rollback any changes 
and throw an exception with error code ‘45000’ and message: 
“Spaceship you are trying to modify does not exists.”
